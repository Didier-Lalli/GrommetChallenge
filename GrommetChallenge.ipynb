    "# Welcome to the DISCOVER Hack Shack Grommet Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you attend the following Discover Hack Shack workshops before attempting this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Git 101\n",
    "2. Streamline app development with open source Grommet\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not, make sure you leverage the notebooks provided in your Jupyter environement for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Fork the Container Challenge Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage Git to distribute and collect responses for this challenge. This means that your reponse will be delivered via a Pull Request on the challenge notebook. Do achieve this, you first need to fork the challenge repository at:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/HPEDevCom/GrommetChallenge.git\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clone the repo locally \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account, you will have to clone a local copy into your Jupyter environement. To do this start a Terminal session from the Jupyter Launcher and use the Git CLI. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Work on your challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the content of the repo is downloaded in your Jupyter account, open the notebook in Jupyter. It's now time for you to do real work :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Racing against the clock\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you are working against the clock here. You have 4 hours after we provided you access to the Jyputer account. If your time is running out, make sure you commit and push your changes to your copy of the repo in order to avoid loosing any work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Build a sample front-end application\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to accomplish this challenge is to create a sample front-end application, and for this we would like you to use Grommet. Keep it simple, all we really need is a sample app with a web interface. The Grommet workshop is your best point of reference at this point, if you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizz question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of the Grommet designer: `Your response goes here`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Run your web application locally\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will consist in making your sample application run locally on your machine. Again this is described in great details in the Grommet Workshop, so don't hesitate to take a look in the corresponding notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Containerize your application\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will consist in making your application run locally in a container. This is the trickiest piece as it's not described in any workshop. We will guide you through it. This step also requires that you have Docker installed on your machine. If this is not the case, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to get Docker started on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Docker runs, you can use the following `Dockerfile` (also provided in the repo) to package your application in a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "FROM node\n",
    " \n",
    "RUN mkdir /app\n",
    "# set working directory\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    " \n",
    "# add `/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH\n",
    "ENV PATH /app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH\n",
    " \n",
    "# install and cache app dependencies\n",
    "COPY package.json /app/package.json\n",
    " \n",
    "RUN npm install --silent\n",
    " \n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "# Application port\n",
    "EXPOSE 3000\n",
    " \n",
    "# Remote debugging port\n",
    "EXPOSE 9229\n",
    " \n",
    "# start app\n",
    "CMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this `Dockerfile`, create a container image for your application. Once the image is created, test your application, by launching a container from that image and connecting to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Upload container in DockerHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have tested your container image built using the provided Dockerfile (and docker build), you will need to tag your image (with docker tag) to prepare it for upload  on your DockerHub account. If you do not have a DockerHub account yet, [create one](https://hub.docker.com/). Once you are logged in your DockerHub account, create an empty repository for your container image. Then upload your container image to your account (using docker push).\n",
    "\n",
    "Check [this article](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) for more details about docker push.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizz Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of your container image repository on Docker: `Your response goes here`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Make your application run in a Kubernetes environement\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final step of the challenge. We will ask you to use the containerized version of your application in a Kubernetes environement managed by HPE Container Platform. In order to do this we will ask you to create a resource file (in YAML) that will create the necessary Kubernetes artifacts to run the Docker image of your application in our K8S cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions of the \"Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API\" notebook to \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to HPE CP \n",
    "2. Retrieve a valid kubeconfig file\n",
    "3. Define your KUBECONFIG environment variable \n",
    "4. Use kubectl manage your K8S Cluster\n",
    "5. Create a my-app.yaml file which declares a **deployment** and a **service** for your application container image\n",
    "\n",
    "Another hint for achieveing this is to try to first get your application to run in the K8S Cluster using `kubectl run -i -t` then use `kubectl get pod -o yaml` to extract the corresponding YAML file. Make sure you use unique names for artifacts so it doesn't conflict with other challengers (for example by appending your name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your YAML file is committed to the repo as this is going to be the nost important part of your response (together with responses to the Quizz Questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your application runs in a K8S pod, connect to it over its public address. Follow carefully the instructions of the \"Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API\" workshop to find out the external IP/port number of your running application. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizz Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of your pod on the public network: `Your response goes here`\n",
    "\n",
    "All done? Well done! It's now time to submit your reponse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting your response \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to submit your response to this challenge, we will ask you to use GitHub to return the modified version of the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commit your changes to local repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Launcher->Terminal session, commit changes locally \n",
    "\n",
    "### Push your changes to your GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "Push your change back to your Github account. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From your repo, submit a pull request to Challenge repo\n",
    "\n",
    "It's now time to submit your response back to the HPE Discover Challenge Repo. To do so, we ask you to submit a Pull Request (PR) from your GitHub account. Make sure an email is provided in the description of the PR so we can find you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wait for jury and/or try another challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We will select a winner per Challenge. Stay tuned for the announcement at the end of HPE Discover Virtual Experience. There will also be a drawing amongst the ones completing all of our challenges, so... back to work! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Congratulations for completing this Challenge!\n"
